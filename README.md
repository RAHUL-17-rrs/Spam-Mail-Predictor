Developed a machine learning model to accurately classify emails as spam or not spam, utilizing various text processing techniques and classification algorithms.
Data Collection and Preparation: Collected a dataset of emails, labeled as spam or non-spam, and performed data cleaning and preprocessing.
Feature Extraction: Employed text vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer to transform email text into numerical features.
Model Development: Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify the most effective model.
Model Evaluation and Tuning: Used cross-validation and grid search to optimize hyperparameters, achieving high accuracy and precision in spam detection.
Implementation: Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly application for real-time email classification.
